My implementation of some mathematical objects such as:
# Linear recurrent sequence in bit representation as well as in byte representation
# A Boolean Function class
That class has been written that allows you to find Walsh-Hadamard coefficients of the 1st kind, Walsh-Hadamard coefficients of the 2nd kind, the full weight structure of the function, the full analytical structure of the function, the weight of the function, the Zhegalkin Polynomial by several methods: The Pascal triangle method, the fast Fourier transform.
# Polynomials class
Basic arithmetic operations, plus the largest common divisor
